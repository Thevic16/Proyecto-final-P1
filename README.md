# Proyecto-final-P1

SUMMARY
The realization of this project was based on what is known as the design and drawing of geometric figures    in  3rd  dimension. This  led  to the  design  and  realization of a  series  of  classes  and  methods,  whose  objectives  were  fundamental  to  the  success  in the operation of the    program.     in its entirety. One of the peculiarities of this project was the use of Java 3D, which helped  with the design itself of the geometric figures in 3D.  They made  the  logical  and visual packages, which contain the key classes  and  methods  already    mentioned  above. A package was also created where the figures can be created in 3D, which was called  3D Figures.
